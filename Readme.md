For initialization on node.js

Start off with npm init -y
For installing Jest

npm i -D Jest
For installing Axios

npm i axios
For adding watcher go to package.json and "testwatch":"jest --watchAll"

"scripts": { "test": "jest", "testwatch":"jest --watchAll" },

After that execute npm run testwatch to enter the developer mode whilst running the code

Last but no least use npm run test for execution of unit test cases

I will be updating this repository again
